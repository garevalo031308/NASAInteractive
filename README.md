# NASAInteractive

An interactive app for classification models used in NASA CNN independent study.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to be able to compare and contrast two different types of image classification models. Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers. The application will allow you to be able to test and try both models on their respective datasets. As well as be able to see the different metrics for each model.

## Introduction

This project is an interactive application designed to demonstrate and utilize classification models developed during an independent study on NASA's Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Parts of the Application
Within this application, multiple pages help demonstrate these classification models:
- Datasets Page
- Abstract Page
- Definitions Page
- Models Page
- Testing Models Page
- Classifier Clash Page

# Datasets Page
Within this page, you can check the datasets that we used throughout the independent study. On this first page, we have a list of datasets, but you can click on the links
to check out the actual images that are within the dataset.

Within each dataset, we can see the actual images that are within the dataset, while also being able to sort them based on the class of the image. As well as we can also
check the distribution of the images between each class as well.

# Abstract Page
On this page, you can check the abstract for our independent study.

# Definitions Page
On this page, we have a list of definitions for things that are important to know about when it comes to Convolution Neural Networks.

# Models Page
On this page, we have a list of the models we have done throughout our independent study. It shows us the name, an image of the model, as well as the dataset it was running on.

You can check each model, which shows important facts about the model. For instance, there is a description of the model, a conclusion, etc. As well as we can check the individual performance of 
each model for better statistics.

# Classifier Clash Page
On this page, is the game of the application. Within this game, people can play against the models, and test to see if they are better than the model that they are competing against.
