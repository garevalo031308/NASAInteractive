Classifier Clash:

Setup:
	- AI Selection: Player selects CNN models
	- Dataset chosen at random (if model contains multiple datasets) or can choose datasets

Game Rounds
	- Display an image at start of round
	- Display four multiple-choice options as answers
	- Player selects answer while AI processes classification
	- Must classify image within fixed time limit (faster response = more bonus points)

Scoring
	- Correct classification:
		- Player: +10pts
		- AI: +10pts
	- Time Bonus
		- Player/AI additional +2pts for every second saved
	- Incorrect Choice
		- No points

Challenges:
	- Distorted images
		- Feature distorted images for increase difficulty
	- Rapid rounds
		- Multiple images flash on screen
		- Classification needs to be made quickly


Difficulty:
	- Easy: No changes to the images
	- Medium: Rotated images, etc.
	- Hard: Distorted images

Game Modes:
	- Quick match:
		- 10 rounds with increasing difficulty
	- Endurance Mode:
		- Unlimited Rounds until player misses 3 classifications
	- Challenge Mode:
		- Blitz Challenge
			- Guess as many images as possible within 60 seconds
		- Rapid Rounds

Winning Conditions:
	- Player Victory:
		- Player scores higher than AI by end of game
	- AI Victory
		- AI outperforms player in accuracy and speed

Advanced Features
	- Statistics: Stats page
		- Player Accuracy
		- AI Accuracy
		- Response Times

Next Steps:
	- load model
	- Create AI functions
		- Accepts image
		- outputs class prediction and confidence score
	- Allow choice of dataset based off what AI already knows
	- Preprocess images with correct input size of AI models
	- Random image selection
	- Display image to player, and pass it to AI model for classification
	- Timer to ensure both player and AI respond within set time
	- Implement logic to compare player's input and AI's prediction
	- Award points based on accuracy and speed

UI:
	- Allow player to select AI model and dataset
	- Game screen
		- Display image prominently (kind of like kahoot)
		- Show multipel choice classificaiton options for player
		- Include timer and score tracker
	- Result Screen
		- Display final scores, accuracy percentages, and round-by-round comparisons

Game Flow:
	- Game Loop
		- For each round
			- Display image
			- Collect player input via UI
			- Pass image to AI for classifcation
			- Compare responses

Features and Challeneges
	- Difficulty levels
	- Analytics (leaderboard)
	- Image difficulty
		- Database
			- Get image correct to incorrect ratio
			- More % correct, easy
			- More % incorrect, hard

Future:
	- AI keeps learning as it plays as well
	- Multiplayer
